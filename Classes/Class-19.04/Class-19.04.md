# Good evening again!

So lets start with:
1. Any questions, concerns or thoughts from our last lecture? Homework? 
2. So one from me, what did we talk about last time? 
3. And, how Azure is secured?

Some quick terms to repeat:
1. RBAC - Role Based Access Control
2. VNet - Virtual Network
3. Best practices when securing your Azure resources (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/best-practices-and-patterns)
4. Azure Pricing Calculator (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)

# Data Strategy

So first let us talk about data in organizations. 
Why do we care so much?

This is a strategy called a data-driven-organization.

And how do we get there:

This is not easy.   
And never this beutiful and nice.  
But always - we aim for perfection dealing with blockers along the way.  

Usual problems:
1. Technology debt\ Legacy tools
2. Unskilled teams
3. Lack of unified data platform
4. Slim relathionship between Business and Tech
5. Dispartion of data sources
6. Lack of data governance
7. Unwillingness to change (old style leadership)
8. Prioritising speed over quality

# Azure Data Services - Big Picture

So, as mentioned before, we will be talking about Azure Data Services today. 
All we talked about before - infrastructure is the base of data stack. 
There is no data without identity, security and access control. 

So we are here:
